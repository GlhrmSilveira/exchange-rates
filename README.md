API in this project does work more 


unfortunately the api I got from https://github.com/public-api-lists on Currency Exchange, https://exchangeratesapi.io/ but it's HORRIBLE unfortunately I didn't know how to use it, as it's now paid and it's an Auth API Key... That's what I think... Maybe have a error hiden here who i can't found
